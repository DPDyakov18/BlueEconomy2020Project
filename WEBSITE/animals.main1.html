                    People and nature have to co-exist in harmony. Things started to spin out of control once the perfect balance was shattered. Human activity on Earth is causing a lot of problems for the entire ecosystem, and plants are not an exception. First of all, they serve as a source of nutrition for many living creatures. In this article, we will uncover what animals eat trees and how they influence our habitat.It is not a secret that fruit, leaves, buds and seedlings are extremely precious nutrients in the wild nature. In fact, every tree serves as a complex ecosystem for a big number of living things, including insects. It basically can’t be put in numbers how many animals live in trees and how these serve as shelter and provision at the same time.

                <h3> What creatures are using trees as their home?</h3>
                <p>
                    The rainforests are full of life. You can find monkeys, sloths, parrots, frogs, snakes, worms, spiders, butterflies, and beetles there. All of them use big plants for shelter and food. So how do trees help these animals to survive? As long as they exist, all these creatures have a home. Intense deforestation is changing this situation for them, and they don’t have any other alternatives but to retract to places untouched by human presence.We can’t overlook nature’s food chains. Healthy trees can be full of beetles, worms, caterpillars and other insect larvae. These serve as nutrition for birds and small organisms. The cycle of life very much depends on the overall state of rainforests. All the animals that eat trees and need shelter will slowly disappear because of human interference. Planting them and protecting what we have has to be our primary goal.
