                <h3>Why Trees Matter: Water Conservation</h3>
                <p>
                    Much of the water that travels inland does not come from oceans, which also release moisture into the air that forms rainclouds. Oceanic moisture accounts for rain that reaches only 150 miles from the coast. Through tree evaporation and transpiration, air is remoistened as it travels farther inland from oceans and this accounts for much of the rainfall away from coastal areas. Trees and other small vegetation return nearly 70% of rain back into the air which then maintains the water, or rain, cycle and recharges rivers and lakes. Without trees the interior parts of continents would become deserts, such as in Australia and Africa were deforestation has led to minimal rainfall.In an opposite but related vein, trees help redistribute and clean water by retaining stormwater runoff (refer to the diagram below). Trees prevent flooding from storms by trapping water in their leaves, trunks, and roots. One mature tree can potentially intercept 1,000 gallons of water a year. Some studies estimate that urban forests can reduce annual runoff by 2-7 percent and with strategic tree landscaping, nearly 65% of storm runoff can be reduced in residential areas. Additionally, trees improve water quality by trapping water that would normally run-off into waterways, carrying with it soil that contains sediments and nutrients. While nutrient-carrying soil may sound beneficial, excessive nutrients like nitrogen or phosphorus can lead to an overgrowth of aquatic plants that reduce oxygen content and disrupt fish life. Finally, trees help collect and filter water for local aquifers and watersheds that replenish the groundwater needed to supply drinking water for much of the world’s population.
